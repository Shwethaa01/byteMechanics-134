PROAIR

OBJECTIVE: To precisely suggest specific plant vegetation based on the concentration of different pollutants present in that location to nullify the effects of that particular toxin so a healthy and a safe AQI(Air Quality Index) can be maintained.

In this app we have :

1)Identified the levels of 10 main harmful pollutant which drags down the AIQ(Air Quality Index),and its varying levels in that location.

2)Secondly, suggested specific trees species (that are suitable for the area) that can nullify the highest concentrated pollutants along with a short description of the present air quality is displayed with a descriptive pie chart showing the distribution of pollutants in each place
